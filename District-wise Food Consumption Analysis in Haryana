District-wise Food Consumption Analysis in Haryana (NSSO 68)
Overview

This assignment analyzes household food consumption patterns in Haryana using data from the NSSO 68th Round. The objective is to explore how food consumption varies across districts and to visualize these differences using statistical summaries, bar charts, and geospatial choropleth maps.

The analysis is implemented in both R and Python to demonstrate cross-language analytical skills and reproducibility.

Objectives

Filter NSSO household survey data for the state of Haryana

Explore the distribution of food consumption expenditure

Compute average food consumption by district

Visualize district-level differences using:

Histograms

Bar plots

Choropleth maps

Dataset

NSSO 68th Round Household Consumption Survey

Key variable used:

foodtotal_v – total food consumption expenditure (₹)

Additional identifiers:

State code (state_1)

District code / name

Methodology
Step 1: Data Loading

Imported NSSO survey data

Loaded Haryana district boundary GeoJSON for spatial analysis

Step 2: Data Filtering

Filtered observations where state_1 == "HR" (Haryana)

Converted district identifiers to categorical/factor types where required

Step 3: Exploratory Analysis

Plotted histograms to examine the distribution of food consumption

Identified skewness and variability in household expenditure

Step 4: District-level Aggregation

Grouped data by district

Calculated average food consumption expenditure per district

Mapped district codes to district names for readability

Step 5: Visualization

Bar plots comparing average food consumption across districts

Choropleth maps showing spatial variation in food consumption:

Darker shades indicate higher average expenditure

District labels added for clarity

Tools & Technologies
R

dplyr – data manipulation

ggplot2 – visualization

sf – spatial data handling

Python

pandas – data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization

geopandas – spatial analysis

Key Insights

Food consumption expenditure varies significantly across Haryana districts

Urbanized districts tend to show higher average food spending

Spatial visualization helps identify regional consumption inequality

Combining survey data with geographic boundaries enhances interpretability

Notes

File paths in the code should be updated to match your local system

District names in the GeoJSON must align with the NSSO district naming convention

This project is part of academic coursework and demonstrates applied data analysis and visualization techniques
